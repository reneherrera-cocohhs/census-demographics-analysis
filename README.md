# 2020 Census Data Project

## Purpose 


Identify vulnerable populations in the County to inform what kinds of programs would be most needed and useful in different areas based on the demographics living there.


We would like to see single data sets extracted for a cross-county comparison of each 2020 Census tracts as a starting point. Ultimately this information will be overlayed on GIS maps and color-coded for visual comparison. The data could be displayed based on the estimated population in each tract and the % and number within that census tract that is counted in each identified category. The categories we would like to see extracted for each census tract are as follows:


- Single parents and gender
- Number of children
- Number of Seniors
- Ages broken out 0-5, 5-14, 15-19, 20-44, 45-64, 65-69, 70+
- Average income, broken out by gender, if possible
- Employment, broken out further by gender
- Number renting vs. owning vs. homeless
  - % of housing units with more people than rooms
- Education level
  - Persons with no high school diploma (25+)
- Households with no vehicle
